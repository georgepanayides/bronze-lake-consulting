Analytics and Reporting
Where is your business flying blind? What insights, if known, could help you make
more money or attract more clients? Utilising data is often overlooked and underserved,
leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. As a business consultant in Christchurch,
we focus on helping you leverage analytics and reporting to enhance performance and make
informed decisions.
Our approach consists of three main areas: analytics for problem-solving, reporting to
uncover insights, and automated KPI tracking.
1. Analytics: Solving Problems and Improving Performance
The Problem: Many businesses find it challenging to derive actionable insights from their
data. This leads to missed opportunities and inefficient operations.
Our Solution: We employ advanced analytics to analyse both internal and external data. Our
thorough approach helps identify issues and uncover opportunities for improvement, allowing
you to make data-driven decisions.
Benefits:
 Improved decision-making based on reliable insights.
 Identification of market opportunities and customer needs.
 Enhanced operational efficiency.
Without Proper Analytics: Neglecting analytics can lead to poor decision-making and a
loss of competitive edge. Just like sailing a ship with no captain or direction, how can you
expect to make big decisions regarding your business without the data to inform you
2. Reporting and data collection: Uncovering Unknowns
The Problem: More often than not data is underutilised, leaving gaps in understanding that
can hinder string decision-making. Many businesses possess a wealth of information, but
without an effective data collection system, this information remains untapped. Insights and
answers may be right at your fingertips, yet without the ability to organise, analyse, and
present that data in a meaningful way, they can go unnoticed.

Our Solution: We develop tailored reporting and data collection processes that clarify your
data and highlight key areas of concern. Our goal is to make data accessible and actionable,
allowing you to see not just the numbers, but their implications.
Benefits:
 Real-time access to data for timely decisions.
 Clearer understanding of business performance.
 Greater transparency for stakeholders.

Without Effective Reporting: Poor reporting can result in misunderstandings about
performance and ineffective strategies. Without a data collection system, useful insights will
remain untapped and your business will continue to fly blind.
3. KPI Tracking: Automation and Modern Solutions
The Problem: Manually tracking KPIs can be time-consuming and prone to error, diverting
attention from core practises.
Our Solution: We use automation and AI to streamline KPI tracking, creating systems that
minimize manual effort. This modern approach ensures accurate, real-time live monitoring of
your performance metrics.
Benefits:
 Time savings through automated processes.
 Increased accuracy in tracking.
 Quick adjustments based on real-time data.
Without Modern KPI Tracking: Failing to automate can mean wasted labour-hours with a
lag in your tracking, while also being prone to mistakes.
Why Choose Us?
Our expertise in automation and technology sets us apart. We focus on turning data into
actionable insights, enabling you to make informed decisions and drive your business
forward.
Let’s work together to harness the power of your data and enhance your business
performance.

Strategy Consulting
Business strategy consulting helps organisations define where they are today, clarify where
they want to go, and create a practical plan for getting there. True strategy is a structured
roadmap grounded in deep analysis of your market, competition, capabilities, finances, and
data. It determines your priorities, positions you competitively, and sets the direction for your
decisions.
The Problem Without a Defined Strategy
Without a clear strategy, organisations often drift:
 Leadership lacks clarity on what matters most and why,
 Decision-making becomes reactive, not intentional,
 Resource allocation is inconsistent with long-term value creation,
 Teams work unaligned or pursue conflicting goals,
Many businesses also fall into the trap of focusing on day-to-day operations without ever
stepping back to evaluate whether what they’re doing will win in the marketplace. According
to industry research, organisations with strong strategic guidance are significantly more likely
to outperform competitors and improve financial performance, whereas those without it often
struggle to adapt to change and unlock growth.
Our Solution
At Bronze Lake Consulting, we are all about building a strategy that works in practice,
not just on paper. Our approach combines analytics with real-world understanding of
business pressures:
 Clarity of Purpose: We work with you to define strategic priorities that align your
leadership, stakeholders and teams.
 Data-Informed Insights: Rather than intuition alone, we ground strategy in the best
available evidence — internal performance data, market trends, customer behaviour
and competitive analysis.
 Actionable Roadmaps: We don’t stop at high-level ideas. Our strategies include
implementation plans, measurable milestones and confidence in execution.
 Automation and KPI Integration: We leverage up to date tools, automation, and
KPI frameworks so strategy becomes visible and trackable, not just aspirational.
With clear strategy consulting you gain confidence in decisions, avoid costly missteps, and
position your business for sustainable competitive advantage.

Growth Planning
Growth planning is a specialised discipline that takes strategic direction and turns it into a
growth engine. It identifies where the greatest opportunities lie, whether through market
expansion, new products, pricing optimisation, channel development, or operational
improvements. Growth planning maps out a practical, measurable path to capture that value.
The Problem Without Effective Growth Planning
Many businesses want to grow, but growth without a plan is often:
 Unpredictable: you can’t anticipate resource requirements, cash flow needs or
bottlenecks.
 Unprofitable: you expand volume without understanding cost structures, margins, or
customer lifetime value.
 Reactive: chasing opportunities that emerge rather than proactively targeting those
with greatest impact.
Without structured growth planning, companies risk exhausting limited resources on
initiatives that deliver little return or, worse, slow down the core business.
Our Approach &amp; Your Benefits
Bronze Lake Consulting brings a disciplined, analytics-driven approach to growth planning
that helps you:
 Assess Opportunities Systematically: We identify high-impact growth levers based
on market dynamics, customer segmentation, and internal performance data.
 Align Growth With Financial Goals: Our planning ensures growth drives
profitability, not just top-line revenue.
 Build Predictable, Scalable Systems: We help you integrate automation, KPI
dashboards and reporting so growth progress is transparent and guided by
evidence, not guesswork.
 Turn Insights Into Action: Where others stop at analysis, we map analysis to
practical initiatives — with accountability, timelines and measurable outcomes.
With robust growth planning, you gain a clear path from where you are to where you want to
be, minimising risk, improving execution confidence, and unlocking long-term, sustainable
growth.

Technology &amp; Software Integration
Identifying Gaps &amp; Recommending Fit-for-Purpose Software
The Problem: Manual, Fragmented, or Inefficient Processes
Many businesses struggle with internal systems that are manual, fragmented, outdated, or
simply not fit for purpose. This creates:
 Repetitive and error-prone tasks
 Lack of visibility into performance or KPIs
 Siloed data and inconsistent reporting
 Slow operational workflows that limit growth
Without a clear understanding of where technology can add value, businesses often invest in
tools that solve symptoms rather than root challenges — leading to wasted spend, frustrated
teams, and a lack of measurable outcomes.
Our Solution: Gap Identification &amp; Best-Fit Software Integration
At Bronze Lake Consulting, we systematically identify where technology will make the
greatest impact in your business by:
 Conducting a thorough diagnostic of your current systems, processes, and data flows
 Mapping key operational bottlenecks, manual tasks, and reporting blind spots
 Prioritising gaps that can be solved or improved through software
Once priority opportunities are identified, we research, evaluate and recommend the best
software solutions that align with your strategic goals, budget, and technical environment.
We don’t recommend tools based on trends — we match tools to your business needs.
What You Get
✔ Clear documentation of process gaps and opportunities
✔ A tailored software shortlist with cost/benefit rationale
✔ Confidence in your technology investments
✔ Tools that automate work, consolidate data, and deliver real intelligence
Smooth Implementation &amp; Training
We then:
1. Learn the selected platform(s) deeply before implementation
2. Configure and integrate software with your existing systems
3. Train your team in practical, results-focused usage
4. Embed reporting and dashboards so insights are instantly actionable
The result: faster processes, fewer errors, better reporting, and a workforce empowered by
tools — not frustrated by them.

Custom Software Development
The Problem: Off-the-Shelf Software Isn’t Enough
In many cases, businesses find that no available software fits their unique processes, data
model, or strategic ambitions. They end up:
 Working around limitations rather than eliminating them
 Paying for features they never use
 Losing time to manual workarounds
 Connecting many applications to do one task
 Struggling to unify data across platforms
Generic tools can help in broad areas, but without customisation, they often become another
constraint rather than an enabler.
Our Solution: Purpose-Built Software Designed for Your Business
When bespoke solutions are needed, we design and build custom software applications that
address your precise needs. This includes:
 Custom dashboards and analytics platforms
 Workflow automation tools
 Integration layers between disparate systems
 Tailored reporting engines with automatic KPI delivery
Each solution is coded, tested, and delivered with performance, security, and usability in
mind.
How It Works
1. Requirements Discovery: We work with your team to define exactly what the
solution must achieve.
2. Specification &amp; Design: We map workflows, user roles, data models, and technical
requirements.
3. Development &amp; QA: We build the solution with clean architectures and thorough
testing.
4. Deployment &amp; Support: We implement it into your live environment and stand by
performance.
